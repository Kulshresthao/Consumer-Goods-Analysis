Consumer Goods SQL Challenge

This project is part of the Codebasics Resume Project Challenge.

Project Description

Atliq Hardwares (a fake company) makes computer parts and is a big player in India, with some business overseas, too.

The bosses there realized they weren't getting quick, smart insights to help them make decisions. So, they want to grow their data team by hiring junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, the data analytics boss, wants someone with tech skills and people skills. That’s why he's doing a SQL challenge to check both.

What you get:

a. The Data: It's got a full rundown of the tables in the (atliq_hardware_db) database. It has deets for six tables:

dim_customer: info on customers
dim_product: info on products
fact_gross_price: gross prices for each product
fact_manufacturing_cost: how much it costs to make each product
fact_pre_invoice_deductions: any discounts before the bill
fact_sales_monthly: sales each month for each product

b. The Metadata: This gives you the lowdown on what each table is all about.

What I Did:
I acted like I was applying for the job. Here's what I did:
Looked at the requests to see what insights the company needed.
Used SQL in MySQL to get those answers.
Made a presentation to show the insights to the big guys.
